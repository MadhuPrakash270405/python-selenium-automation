# Python Selenium Automation

Welcome to the Python Selenium Automation repository! This project is designed to provide examples, best practices, and a starting point for those interested in web browser automation using Python and Selenium. Whether you're automating tests for web applications or exploring web scraping, this repository serves as a practical guide.

## Introduction

Selenium is a powerful framework for automating web browsers. It can simulate user actions like clicking, typing, and navigating through web pages, making it an invaluable tool for testing web applications. Python, with its simple and readable syntax, complements Selenium, allowing for the creation of sophisticated scripts and automation sequences with ease.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x - Download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A web driver compatible with your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
  - [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
  - [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver)
  - [EdgeDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MadhuPrakash270405/python-selenium-automation.git
   cd python-selenium-automation
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Unix/MacOS:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

After installation, you can run the provided example scripts to see Selenium in action.

For example:

```bash
python example_script.py
```

*Replace `example_script.py` with the script you want to run.*

## Writing Your Own Scripts

You can start adding your scripts to the repository. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file in the project directory.
2. Import Selenium and other necessary libraries.
3. Write functions to perform your desired automation tasks.
4. Test your script by running it in your environment.
